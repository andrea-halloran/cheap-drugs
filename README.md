# CheapDrugs

## Value Add Proposal

**CheapDrugs** is a drug cost comparison and pharmacy location app. CheapDrugs looks at the minimum, wholesale drug price and compares it to the prices charged at the pharmacies located near the user. The user can save their preferred pharmacies in the app, and compare the prices in the area. With the rise in health costs, we want to give the power back to the user to easily find affordable drug prices and educational resources to help them better understand their prescribed healthcare.
